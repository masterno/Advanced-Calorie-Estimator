üöÄ README: Advanced Calorie Estimator 2.0
üìù Project Overview
The Advanced Calorie Estimator is a web application that provides a data-driven prediction of calorie expenditure during a workout. Unlike generic calculators that use simple, theoretical formulas, this tool is powered by a machine learning model trained on thousands of real-world exercise sessions from two distinct datasets.

This project followed an iterative development process, starting with a simple model and progressively increasing its complexity and accuracy by combining data, using more powerful algorithms, and ultimately, engineering more intelligent features. The final result is a robust and nuanced predictor that balances high performance with practical application.

ü§ñ The Final Predictive Model
The core of this application is a Linear Regression model built on a rich set of engineered features. While we experimented with more complex algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, we discovered that the key to unlocking the highest performance was not the algorithm itself, but the quality of the information we provided it.

The Modeling Journey
Initial Model: A simple linear model was trained on a single dataset. It performed well but failed to generalize to new, unseen data.

Data Combination: We merged two different exercise datasets to create a larger, more diverse training set.

Advanced Algorithms: We trained RandomForest and XGBoost models, which improved performance but hit a plateau, indicating the limits of the original features.

Feature Engineering: This was the breakthrough step. We created polynomial and interaction features to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between the inputs (e.g., how the effect of heart rate changes with weight and age).

Adding Demographics: We incorporated Gender as a feature, allowing the model to learn different patterns for males and females.

Final App-Ready Model: To create a model that was both powerful and simple enough to implement in a web app, we trained a final Linear Regression model using our full set of engineered features. This provided a single, highly accurate formula.

Final Model Performance
The final model, which powers the app, achieved the following performance on unseen test data:

R-squared (R¬≤): 0.8720

This indicates that our model successfully explains 87.2% of the variability in calorie burn, a very strong result.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 105.47 calories

This means that, on average, the model's predictions are off by about 105 calories. Given the wide range of workouts, this represents a solid level of accuracy for real-world estimation.

üöÄ How to Use the App
